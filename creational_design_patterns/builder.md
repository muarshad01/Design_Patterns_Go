## Builder Design Pattern

[Builder in Go](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/go/example)

Builder is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.

Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesnâ€™t require products to have a common interface. That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.
