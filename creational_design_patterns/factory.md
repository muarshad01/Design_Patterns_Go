## Factory Design Pattern

[Factory Method in Go](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method/go/example)

Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.
