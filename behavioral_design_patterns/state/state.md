## State Behavioral Pattern

[State in Go](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state/go/example#example-0)

State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.

The pattern extracts state-related behaviors into separate state classes and forces the original object to delegate the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.
