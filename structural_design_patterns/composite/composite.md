## Composite Design Pattern

[Composite in Go](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite/go/example)

Composite is a structural design pattern that allows composing objects into a tree-like structure and work with it as if it was a singular object.

Composite became a pretty popular solution for the most problems that require building a tree structure. Compositeâ€™s great feature is the ability to run methods recursively over the whole tree structure and sum up the results.
