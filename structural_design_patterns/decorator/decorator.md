## Decorator Design Pattern

[Decorator in Go](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator/go/example)

Decorator is a structural pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects, called decorators.

Using decorators you can wrap objects countless number of times since both target objects and decorators follow the same interface. The resulting object will get a stacking behavior of all wrappers.
